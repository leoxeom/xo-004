# PLANNER Suite

This repository contains the early experimental code for **PLANNER Suite**, a modular planning application. The project is bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and React using TypeScript.

## Getting started

```bash
cd planner-suite
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build for production

```bash
cd planner-suite
npm run build
```

The main modules described in `planner_suite_prd.json` will be implemented progressively starting with the Stage Planner.
